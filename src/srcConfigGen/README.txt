Overall Notes:

*Each configuration subdirectory contains two critical files: 'template' and 'master_input'
*Currently, only the prodConf directory has a functional template and master_input example (the consumer, broker, and topic are future developments)



Usage Notes:

*cd into subdirectory and run './makeScript.sh'
*this will produce the grid search configuration files
*if you want to edit configs: (1) add, remove or edit the default config value in the template file  &  (2) add, remove, or edit the grid seach values in the master_input file
